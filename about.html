					<p> DISARIO was founded with the aim of offering an excellent and lasting product. Reflecting the origins of the founder, who was born in Holland to Italian parents, the brand unites the high level of Italian manufacturing with a more clean northern aesthetic. 
					<br>
					<br>

					More than fashion trends, weâ€™re into product design. Therefore, our first step in our development process is to patiently research the best available materials, which we mostly find in Italy. Speaking the language has been fundamental in creating relationships with key suppliers and workshops in Italy, such that we can offer a product of such high standards.
					<br>
					<br>
					
					In selecting the materials for our clothes and accessories, we concentrate on the touch and feel of the fabric. All other details of our products are also carefully considered, from the zips of our jackets to the
					buckles of our belts, even to the stitches on the collars of our shirts. This process takes
					time. As a result, we plan to only gradually add products to our collection. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Ultimately, we want the wearer to feel the care and consideration put into each piece, and our
					goal is to simplify dressing.
