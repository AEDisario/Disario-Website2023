					<p>
					DISARIO was founded by Alessandro Disario with the aim of offering an excellent and lasting product. Reflecting the origins of the founder, who was born in Holland to Italian parents, the brand unites the high level of Italian manufacturing with a more clean northern aesthetic. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Alessandro has always been compelled by a really good product, be it a well-prepared meal or a perfectly cut shirt. During his years in Florence, where he went to study mathematics, this curiosity slowly materialized. Standing in a tradition of northerners who have been profoundly moved during their stay in Italy, he felt the wish to create something of value. Clothing and accessoires that enhance the act of dressing. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Therefore, more than fashion trends, weâ€™re into product design. We start our development process with patiently researching the best available materials, which we find in Italy. Speaking the language has been fundamental in creating relationships with key suppliers and workshops in Italy, such that we can offer a product of the highest standards.
					<br>
					<br>
					In selecting the materials for our clothes and accessories, we concentrate on the touch and feel of the fabric. All other details of our products are also carefully considered, from the zips of our jackets to the buckles of our belts, even to the stitches on the collars of our shirts. This process takes time. As a result, we plan to only gradually add products to our collection. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Ultimately, we want the wearer to feel the care and consideration put into each piece.
